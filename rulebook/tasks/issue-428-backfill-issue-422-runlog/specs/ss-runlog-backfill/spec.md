# Spec: ss-runlog-backfill (issue-428)

## Purpose

Ensure OpenSpec run logs are complete and accurate after delivery.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Run log entries are backfilled when missing

SS MUST update `openspec/_ops/task_runs/ISSUE-422.md` so it:
- contains the real PR link for the completed work
- reflects merged/synced completion in `Status` / `Next Actions`
- includes minimal `Runs` entries for PR creation and merge verification
