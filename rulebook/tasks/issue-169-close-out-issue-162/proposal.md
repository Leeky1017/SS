# Proposal: issue-169-close-out-issue-162

## Why
- Close out Phase 3.2 task card and archive the rulebook task for Issue #162 to satisfy the SS delivery workflow (auditability + no stale tasks).

## What Changes
- Mark Phase 3.2 task card acceptance checklist complete and add a `## Completion` section with PR link + run log.
- Move `rulebook/tasks/issue-162-composition-plan-schema-routing/` into `rulebook/tasks/archive/`.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `openspec/specs/ss-do-template-optimization/task_cards/phase-3.2__composition-plan-schema-and-routing.md`
- Affected code: none
- Breaking change: NO
- User benefit: keeps delivery artifacts complete and easy to audit.
