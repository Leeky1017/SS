# Spec Delta: Phase 5.6 closeout hygiene

## Goal

Ensure Phase 5.6 (Issue #246) has complete, navigable delivery evidence after the implementation PR is merged.

## Requirements

- Task card `phase-5.6__panel-advanced-TF.md` records:
  - `Issue: #246`
  - Acceptance checklist marked complete
  - `## Completion` includes PR link and run log path
- Run log `openspec/_ops/task_runs/ISSUE-246.md` is updated to:
  - Reflect merged + synced status
  - Append post-merge verification + sync/cleanup commands under `## Runs`
- Rulebook task `issue-246-p5-6-panel-advanced-tf` is archived (moved under `rulebook/tasks/archive/`).
