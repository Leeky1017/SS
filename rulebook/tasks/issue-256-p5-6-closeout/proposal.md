# Proposal: issue-256-p5-6-closeout

## Why
Close out Phase 5.6 admin artifacts so delivery evidence is complete and discoverable (task card + run log + Rulebook archive).

## What Changes
- Update Phase 5.6 task card metadata/checklist and add completion notes (PR link + run log).
- Update `ISSUE-246` run log status and append post-merge sync/cleanup runs.
- Archive Rulebook task `issue-246-p5-6-panel-advanced-tf`.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `openspec/specs/ss-do-template-optimization/task_cards/phase-5.6__panel-advanced-TF.md`
- Affected code: none
- Breaking change: NO
- User benefit: Clear traceability (task card ↔ PR ↔ run log) and reduced clutter (task archived).
