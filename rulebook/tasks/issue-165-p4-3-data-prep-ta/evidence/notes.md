# Notes: issue-165-p4-3-data-prep-ta

## Findings
- (fill) TA* templates still contain legacy `SS_*:` anchors (e.g., `SS_TASK_VERSION:...`, `SS_ERROR:...`, `SS_METRIC:n_input:...`) that should be normalized to pipe-delimited anchors.

## Later
- (fill) Consider aligning smoke-suite missing-deps extraction to support `SS_DEP_MISSING|pkg=...` in addition to legacy variants.
