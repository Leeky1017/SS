# Notes — ISSUE-284 (TM01–TM15)

## Working assumptions
- Stata 18 baseline; prefer built-in `meta` suite over SSC for meta-analysis and funnel plots.
- Best-practice notes belong in template comments and run log (auditable).

## Later (out of scope now)
- Add template-specific example datasets to `assets/stata_do_library/fixtures/` for smoke-suite expansion.
