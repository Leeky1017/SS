# Proposal: issue-511-frontend-ux-audit-spec

## Summary

Write a canonical OpenSpec spec and task cards for the SS frontend UI/UX problem list (64 items), so follow-up agents can implement improvements without re-auditing the codebase or re-deriving design intent.

## Scope

ADDED:
- `openspec/specs/ss-frontend-ux-audit/spec.md`
- `openspec/specs/ss-frontend-ux-audit/task_cards/*.md`

MODIFIED:
- None (no runtime code or CSS changes in this issue).

## Non-goals

- Implementing the UI changes (handled by follow-up issues mapped by the task cards).
- Backend contract changes (only documented as dependencies where relevant).
