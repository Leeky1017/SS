## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Extend inputs upload API to accept multiple files + roles
- [ ] 1.2 Persist datasets under `inputs/` and write multi-dataset `inputs/manifest.json`
- [ ] 1.3 Compute deterministic inputs fingerprint across datasets and update `job.json.inputs`
- [ ] 1.4 Index dataset artifacts + manifest with enumerated kinds

## 2. Testing
- [ ] 2.1 Cover multi-file upload and manifest validation
- [ ] 2.2 Cover backward-compatible single-file upload

## 3. Documentation
- [ ] 3.1 Keep task card metadata up to date and add completion section after merge
