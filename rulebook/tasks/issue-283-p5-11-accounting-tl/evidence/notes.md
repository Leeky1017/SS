# Notes — ISSUE-283 (TL01–TL15)

## Working assumptions
- Stata 18 baseline; keep templates runnable without SSC where possible.
- Best-practice notes belong in template comments and run log (auditable).

## Later (out of scope now)
- Add reusable shared do-snippets for repeated validation blocks (only if repetition becomes unmaintainable).
