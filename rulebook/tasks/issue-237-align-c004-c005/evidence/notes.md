# Notes: issue-237-align-c004-c005

## Focus
- Keep Step3 contract strictly aligned with `openspec/specs/ss-frontend-backend-alignment/spec.md`.
- Prefer minimal wiring changes; extend existing job confirmation model as needed for determinism.

## Later
- Add optional polling test for 202→200 preview transition if/when preview generation becomes async in tests.
