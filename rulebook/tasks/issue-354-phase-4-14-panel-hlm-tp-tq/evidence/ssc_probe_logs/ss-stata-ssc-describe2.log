TITLE
      'XTTEST3': module to compute Modified Wald statistic for groupwise
        heteroskedasticity

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
       xttest3 calculates a modified Wald statistic for groupwise
      heteroskedasticity in the residuals of a fixed effect regression
      model. It is for use after xtreg, fe or xtgls (with the default
      panels option).

TITLE
      'XTABOND2': module to extend xtabond dynamic panel data estimator

DESCRIPTION/AUTHOR(S)
      
           xtabond2 can fit two closely related dynamic panel data
      models. The first is the    Arellano-Bond (1991) estimator, which
      is also available with xtabond without the two-step
      finite-sample correction described below.  The second is an
      augmented version outlined in    Arellano and Bover (1995) and
      fully developed in Blundell and Bond (1998).   Arellano and Bond
      (1991) developed a Generalized Method of    Moments estimator
      that treats the model as a system of equations, one for each time
      period.    The equations differ only in their instrument/moment
      condition sets.  The predetermined and    endogenous variables in
      first differences are instrumented with suitable lags of their
      own  levels.  Strictly exogenous regressors, as well as any
      other instruments, can enter the    instrument matrix in the
      conventional instrumental variables fashion: in first
      differences,   with one column per instrument.    A problem with
      the original Arellano-Bond estimator is that lagged levels are
      often poor instruments for first differences, especially for
      variables that are close to a random   walk.  Arellano and Bover
      (1995) described how, if the original equations in levels were
      added to the system, additional moment conditions could be
      brought to bear to increase  efficiency.  In these equations,
      predetermined and endogenous variables in levels are
      instrumented with suitable lags of their own first differences.
      Blundell and Bond (1998)    articulated the necessary assumptions
      for this augmented estimator more precisely and    tested it with
      Monte Carlo simulations.  The original estimator is sometimes
      called    "difference GMM," and the augmented one, "system GMM."
      Bond (2002) is a good introduction to these estimators and
      their use. xtabond2 implements both estimators.   As GMM
      estimators, the Arellano-Bond estimators have one- and two-step
      variants.  But    though asymptotically more efficient, the
      two-step estimates of the standard errors tend to    be severely
      downward biased (Arellano and Bond 1991; Blundell and Bond 1998).
       To  compensate, xtabond2, unlike xtabond, makes available a
      finite-sample correction to the    two-step covariance matrix
      derived by Windmeijer (2000).  This can make twostep robust more
        efficient than onestep robust, especially for system GMM.
      Note: the routine requires an up-to-date version of Stata 7 (with
      the 21jun2002 update installed).     Users of Stata version 10
      (25feb2008 update) or later can take advantage of speed
      improvements due to Mata.
