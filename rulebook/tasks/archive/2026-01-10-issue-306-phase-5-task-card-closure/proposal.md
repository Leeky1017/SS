# Proposal: issue-306-phase-5-task-card-closure

## Why
Task cards require post-merge closure: acceptance checklist must be checked and a completion section must link merged PRs and run logs for auditability.

## What Changes
- Mark Phase 5.9 and 5.10 task card acceptance checklists as completed.
- Add `## Completion` sections linking PRs and run logs.

## Impact
- Affected specs: `openspec/specs/ss-do-template-optimization/task_cards/phase-5.9__survival-multivariate-TI-TJ.md`, `openspec/specs/ss-do-template-optimization/task_cards/phase-5.10__finance-TK.md`
- Affected code: none
- Breaking change: NO
- User benefit: clear audit trail for Phase 5.9/5.10 delivery
