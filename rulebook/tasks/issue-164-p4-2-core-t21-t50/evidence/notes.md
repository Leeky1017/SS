# Notes — ISSUE-164

## Scope
- Phase 4.2 core audit: templates `T21`–`T50`.

## Decisions
- Use the Phase 3 smoke-suite runner (`python3 -m src.cli run-smoke-suite`) with a phase-scoped manifest to batch-run `T21`–`T50`.

## Later
- Consider extending the default `assets/stata_do_library/smoke_suite/manifest.1.0.json` after Phase 4 coverage stabilizes.
